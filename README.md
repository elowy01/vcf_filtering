# Filtering a VCF
This repo contains the code and workflows used to identify the false positive variants in a VCF file.

For the identification of spurious variants I use a process based on supervised machine learning (ML) using a VCF with highly confident sites to train the model.

More documentation can be found [here](https://github.com/elowy01/vcf_filtering/wiki).
